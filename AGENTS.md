# Starlight Intelligence â€” Agent operating contract

Scope: All repositories under the **Starlight-Intelligence** GitHub Organization.
Brand register: `sis` (Curious, confident, warm, and technical. Lead with what a builder wants to explore or make.)

## Core guardrails

1. **Think before coding.** State assumptions and surface tradeoffs. Verify file contents and branch state before writing.
2. **Surgical changes.** Touch only the files required for the active slice. Never overwrite or reset another agent's uncommitted worktree.
3. **Branch and worktree discipline.** Never push directly to `main`. Work on `agent/<harness>/<scope>` in a dedicated worktree and open a **draft** pull request first.
4. **Maker != Checker.** The harness that authors a pull request never approves or merges its own pull request.
5. **CI budget discipline.** Keep pull requests in draft until local verification (`lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `build`) passes. Mark ready for review once.
6. **Non-waivable safety.**
   - Never commit secrets, API keys, or `.env` files.
   - Preserve repository visibility parity: never copy or mirror private repository contents into a public repository.
   - Money fails closed; no autonomous spend or paid API provisioning without explicit human approval.
   - In health and mind domains, model observations only; never diagnose or make clinical claims.
